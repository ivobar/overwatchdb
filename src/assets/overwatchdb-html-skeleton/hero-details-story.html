                            <div class="hero-bio-backstory pad-sm"><p>The cyborg Genji Shimada has made peace with the
                                augmented body he once rejected, and in doing so, he has discovered a higher
                                humanity.</p>
                                <p>As the youngest son of the master of the Shimada ninja clan, Genji lived a life of
                                    luxury
                                    and privilege. He had little interest in the family's illegal businesses, and
                                    although
                                    he excelled at and enjoyed his ninja training, he spent most of his time pursuing a
                                    playboy lifestyle. Many within the clan considered the carefree Genji to be a
                                    dangerous
                                    liability, and they resented his father for coddling and protecting him. Following
                                    the
                                    clan leader's untimely death, Genji's older brother, Hanzo, demanded that Genji take
                                    a
                                    more active role in their late father's empire. Genji refused, enraging Hanzo. The
                                    tension between the brothers built to a violent confrontation that left Genji on the
                                    verge of dying.</p>
                                <p>Hanzo believed that he had killed his brother, but Genji was rescued by Overwatch and
                                    the
                                    intervention of Dr. Angela Ziegler. The global security force saw Genji as a
                                    potential
                                    asset in its ongoing operations to combat the Shimada clan. As Genji's injuries left
                                    him
                                    clinging to life, Overwatch offered to rebuild his body in exchange for his help. He
                                    was
                                    put through an extensive process of cyberization, which enhanced his natural speed
                                    and
                                    agility and augmented his superlative ninja skills. Transformed into a living
                                    weapon,
                                    Genji single-mindedly set about the task of dismantling his family's criminal
                                    empire.</p>
                                <p>But as time passed, Genji felt increasingly at war with himself. He was repulsed by
                                    the
                                    mechanical parts of his body and could not come to grips with what he had become.
                                    When
                                    his mission was complete, he abandoned Overwatch and wandered the world in search of
                                    meaning. He drifted for many years before crossing paths with the omnic monk
                                    Zenyatta.
                                    Though Genji initially rejected Zenyatta's wisdom, the benevolent omnic would not be
                                    deterred. In time, Zenyatta became his mentor, and under the monk's tutelage, Genji
                                    reconciled his dual existence as both man and machine. He learned to accept that
                                    although he had a cyborg body, his human soul was intact, and he came to see his new
                                    form as a gift and a unique strength.</p>
                                <p>Now, for the first time in his life, Genji is free. Even he cannot say where his path
                                    will ultimately lead.</p>
